=== Abstract ===

At times you might have to handle an archive input stream but you will have no prior knowledge of the archiving method.

Based on the magic headers, the Smart Archive will auto-detect the archiving method and apply it accordingly.

Currently the support types are `tar`, `ar` and `zip`.
The Smart Archive will also apply a `GZip` filter if needed.

=== Usage ===

Usage is simple. To create a Smart Archive instance:
[source,java]
----
import org._10ne.smarchive.SmarchiveInputStream

...

public void readArchiveEntries(InputStream inputStream) {
    ArchiveInputStream archiveStream = SmarchiveInputStream.realize(inputStream);
    ...
}
----
